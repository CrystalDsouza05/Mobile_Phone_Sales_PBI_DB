## ðŸ“Œ About this Dashboard
Designed an interactive 3-page Power BI dashboard analyzing mobile phone sales, customer demographics, and product features. Integrated device images into KPI cards, used matrix data bars for clarity, and implemented ZoomCharts visuals for advanced interactivity. Key insights include dominant purchases by buyers aged 26â€“41, with a strong preference for mid-range Android devices and regional brand differences. This project deepened my skills in dynamic dashboard design and customer behavior analysis.
